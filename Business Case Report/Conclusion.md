Objectives:  
Using NFL concussion data sets to gain knowledge on what factors lead to more frequent concussions in order to help prevent them. 

Methodology: 

For our methodology, we collected our data set from Kaggle, a website that provide sets to work with in R and excel. After downloading the sets, we deliberate on what relevant questions to ask regarding concussions in the NFL. These questions are designed with the idea to relate back to research the NFL can do as well as to formulate recommendations on what to do with said research. The questions are “What team has the most concussions?”, “What opposing team has caused the most concussions?” , “Are the more concussions more likely to happen earlier or later in the season?”, “If you've been concussed once, are you more likely to get another within the next two seasons?”, “Are certain positions more susceptible to concussions?”, and “Does the winning team or losing team typically get injured more often?” For each question, we created bar graphs and pie charts to compare using the data, and to draw conclusions, and analyzed them in order to help with concussion prevention in the NFL. 

Key Findings: 

What team has most concussed players?: 
The Browns had the highest number of concussions 2012-2014. The Bills had the lowest number of concussions during that time 

What time of the season?: 
Most concussions are in first week of season. Second highest is week 12. Lowest in last three weeks (probably because of playoffs) 

If you've been concussed once, are you more likely to get another within the next two seasons?: 
There is a small percentage that following one concussions, a player could get another one (12.31%)​

Are certain positions more susceptible to concussions?: 
Cornerbacks receive the most, seemly because they must tackle hard and aggressively with the role of their position on the field. Wide receiver receives the 2nd most concussions, based on the conclusion that they receive the ball and get tackle and cannot brace themselves unlike other positions 

Does the winning team or losing team typically get injured more often?:  
The loosing team typically experiences more concussions than the winning team, but only by a very small margin, so we do not think that this is significant enough for our research on what factor influences concussions the most.  

 

Insight/Recommendations: 

What team has most concussed players?: With this data, the Browns could do research on the Bills to try and improve their concussion prevention protocols.  

What time of the season?: Teams should do more concussion prevention in preseason and beginning of regular season.  

If you've been concussed once, are you more likely to get another within the next two seasons?: NFL should do preventative care in general, and even more for those impacted multiple times, as well as extra protective gear. They should also have a cap on the number of concussions in a season and withhold players based on too many 

Are certain positions more susceptible to concussions?: Our recommendations is the positions with the most concussions like those wear more padding specific to how they will be hit and can product them better. 

Does the winning team or losing team typically get injured more often?: Based on this data, there doesn’t seem to be any significant difference between winning or losing in terms of concussions, so we have no recommendations.
