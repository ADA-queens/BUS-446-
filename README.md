Final Project on NFL concussions

For our final project, we decided to investigate the data on concussions in the NFL. As athletes ourselves, having dealt with injuries such as concussions in the past, we were fascinated with the correlations between different factors that may influence why some players are more susceptible to these types of injuries than others. In the data we found, it gives us lots of information about the players with the injury.  

The data tells us the players name, the team, the game, the date, the opposing team, the position, if they had a preseason injury, if they were on the winning team, the week of injury, the season, the weeks injured, games missed, if there was an unknown injury, reported injury type, total snaps, play time after injury and average playtime before injury. We picked this specific data on NFL concussions because it gives us so many different factors to explore to see what characteristics have the strongest correlations with concussions in the NFL.  
We put some questions below we would like to explore and answer after doing research and analyzing our data.  

 Question 1: What team had the most concussed players between the seasons 2012-2014?
 Question 2: Are concussions more likely to happen earlier or later in the season?
 Question 3: Are players likely to get concussed again after they have had a concussion previously?
 Question 4: Are certain positions more susceptible to concussions?
